# ancrib

NodeJS web application for showcasing different types of encryption, from Caesar Cipher all the way to AES! Please access at https://infinite-reaches-45802.herokuapp.com/

This project was done as part of my EPQ project in 2020-2021. 9 ciphers are currently included within the app as listed below. These are algorithms that I find were either significant parts of the evolution of cryptography, or demonstrative of basic cryptography concepts. All of these are imiplemented using my own code in JS for learning purposes and is therefore NOT CRYPTOGRAHICALLY SECURE. 

P.S. Some description/history of each algorithm can be shown by toggling the info button on the top right of the site :)

## Main technologies used
- Express
- React
- Jest 
- Heroku 

## Algorithms/Ciphers currently included
- Caesar Cipher
- Columnar Transposition
- Vigen√©re Cipher
- Vernam Cipher
- Enigma (with classic rotors used in war as well as custom rotors)
- MD5 (including HMAC)
- DES/3DES
- SHA-256 (including HMAC)
- AES (128-bit EBC-mode)
